# Water-Flood-Image-Segmentation
Water flood image segmentation detects flooded areas in satellite images using AI. It preprocesses images, applies a model (like U-Net) to separate water from land, and outputs a binary mask highlighting floods. This helps in disaster response, risk assessment, and climate research by identifying and measuring water coverage efficiently.
